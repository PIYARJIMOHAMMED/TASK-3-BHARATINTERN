# TASK-3-BHARATINTERN
# Iris Flower Classification Project

# Overview
This project aims to classify Iris flowers based on their features using both traditional machine learning (Logistic Regression) and a neural network implemented with TensorFlow.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

# Usage
1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Make sure you have the required Python libraries installed by running:
   ```bash pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
